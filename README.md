# Pangolin

> A modern, headless-friendly GlobalProtect VPN client for Linux,
> written in Rust.

`pangolin` (CLI binary `pgn`) connects to Palo Alto Networks
GlobalProtect VPN portals — including modern **Prisma Access**
deployments that use cloud authentication — without needing a desktop
environment, a graphical browser, or `vpn-slice`.

> **Status: early development.** Phase 1 (auth → tunnel handshake) is
> verified end-to-end against a real Prisma Access portal. Routing,
> DNS, daemon mode, multi-portal management, HIP reports, and Windows
> / macOS support are still in flight. See
> [Roadmap](#roadmap) below.

## Why another GlobalProtect client?

There are two main open-source options today:

| | openconnect | yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect | **pangolin** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tunnel | Native ESP/HTTPS | Native (via libopenconnect) | Native (via libopenconnect) |
| SAML auth on a server (no display) | ❌ paste mode only | ❌ requires WebKitGTK window | ✅ **headless paste mode** |
| Prisma Access cloud-auth (`globalprotectcallback:`) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Split tunnel without `vpn-slice` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ **bundled, hostname-aware** |
| CLI-first, daemon-friendly | ⚠️ | ⚠️ GUI-first | ✅ goal |
| HIP report, multi-portal, native gp-route | partial | partial | 🚧 roadmap |

The two things that already make `pangolin` worth using over the
alternatives:

1. **Headless SAML.** `pgn connect --auth-mode paste` starts a tiny
   local HTTP server and walks you through completing SAML in *any*
   browser on *any* machine (the SSH-port-forward case is a one-liner).
   No display, no embedded WebKit, no `xvfb` workaround. The yuezk
   client cannot do this — its `gpauth` is hard-coded to spawn a
   webkit2gtk window.
2. **Client-controlled split tunnel.** `pgn connect --only
   10.0.0.0/8,intranet.example.com` resolves the hostnames before the
   tunnel comes up, then installs *only* those routes through the VPN.
   The default route is left untouched, so your SSH session (and
   anything else not explicitly routed) keeps using your normal
   network. No external `vpn-slice` install required.

A graphical webview path is still available for users who prefer it
(`--auth-mode webview`, default when you have a display).

## Install

### From source

You need:

- Rust **1.80+** (2021 edition)
- `libopenconnect-dev` ≥ 8.20 (with `--protocol=gp` support)
- `libclang-dev` (for `bindgen`)
- `libssl-dev`, `libdbus-1-dev`
- For the optional `webview` SAML mode: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`,
  `libgtk-3-dev`, plus a working display (X11, Wayland, or WSLg)

Debian / Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install -y libopenconnect-dev libclang-dev libssl-dev \
    libdbus-1-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev pkg-config
```

Fedora / RHEL:

```bash
sudo dnf install -y openconnect-devel clang-devel openssl-devel \
    dbus-devel webkit2gtk4.1-devel gtk3-devel pkgconf-pkg-config
```

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kyaky/pangolin
cd pangolin
cargo build --release
sudo install -m 0755 target/release/pgn /usr/local/bin/pgn
```

If you only need headless mode and want to skip the webview deps:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features
```

---

## Quick start

### Headless (server / SSH / container)

```bash
sudo -E pgn connect vpn.example.com \
    --auth-mode paste \
    --only 10.0.0.0/8
```

`pgn` will print something like:

```
┌─ Pangolin — headless SAML authentication ─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Open this URL in any browser (any machine):                              │
│    http://127.0.0.1:29999/                                                │
│                                                                           │
│  Over SSH? Port-forward first:                                            │
│    ssh -L 29999:localhost:29999 …                                         │
│                                                                           │
│  After login, paste the `globalprotectcallback:…` URL here:               │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Open the printed URL on whatever machine has a browser, complete your
identity provider's flow (Azure AD, Okta, Shibboleth, …), copy the
final `globalprotectcallback:` URL out of the browser's address bar
and paste it back into the terminal. The tunnel comes up with only
`10.0.0.0/8` routed through the VPN — your SSH connection survives.

### Desktop (graphical)

```bash
sudo -E pgn connect vpn.example.com
```

By default `pgn` opens a small WebKitGTK window for the SAML flow.

### Full tunnel

If you want every byte to go through the VPN, point at a real
vpnc-script:

```bash
sudo -E pgn connect vpn.example.com \
    --vpnc-script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script
```

(install the `vpnc-scripts` package first).

## CLI reference (work in progress)

```
pgn connect [PORTAL] [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -u, --user <USER>             Username (rarely needed for SAML)
      --passwd-on-stdin         Read password from stdin (non-SAML auth)
      --os <OS>                 Reported OS: win | mac | linux (default: win)
      --insecure                Accept invalid TLS certificates
      --vpnc-script <PATH>      vpnc-compatible script for routes/DNS
      --auth-mode <MODE>        webview | paste (default: webview)
      --saml-port <PORT>        Local port for paste-mode HTTP server (29999)
      --only <CIDR|IP|HOST>     Comma-separated split-tunnel targets

pgn status                     Show the running session (or "disconnected")
pgn disconnect                 Tear down the running session
```

`status` and `disconnect` talk to the running `pgn connect` process
over a Unix control socket at `/run/pangolin/pangolin.sock` (mode
`0600`, owner-only). Because the socket is created by the root-owned
connect process, those subcommands also need `sudo`:

```bash
sudo pgn status
sudo pgn disconnect
```

Both support `--json` for machine-readable output.

## How it works

`pangolin` is a Cargo workspace. The interesting crates:

| crate | what it does |
|---|---|
| `gp-proto` | GlobalProtect XML protocol types (no I/O) |
| `gp-auth` | Authentication providers (`Password`, `SamlBrowser`, `SamlPaste`) and the HTTP client for portal/gateway login |
| `gp-tunnel` | Safe wrapper around `libopenconnect`. Owns the VPN session lifecycle, cancellation via `openconnect_setup_cmd_pipe`, and a C trampoline for libopenconnect's variadic progress callback (stable Rust can't define one) |
| `gp-openconnect-sys` | Raw bindgen FFI bindings + the C trampoline shim |
| `gp-config`, `gp-hip`, `gp-dns`, `gp-route` | Currently mostly stubs — see the roadmap |
| `bins/pgn` | The CLI, `tokio`-based |

Architecture rule of thumb: **`libopenconnect` handles the tunnel,
Rust handles everything else.** That includes authentication, portal
config, gateway selection, HIP, route installation, and reconnect
policy. We never reimplement ESP/UDP, never shell out to the
`openconnect` binary, and never run a Python helper script.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1 — done

- Workspace scaffold + libopenconnect FFI
- GP protocol types and XML parsing
- Password + SAML (webview + paste) auth providers
- Prisma Access `globalprotectcallback:` JWT capture
- `pgn connect` end-to-end: prelogin → SAML → portal config → gateway
  login → CSTP → TUN → DPD keepalives
- Bundled minimal vpnc-script + `--only` split tunnel
- Clean Ctrl-C cancellation via `openconnect_setup_cmd_pipe`

### Phase 2 — next

- ~~`pgn status` / `pgn disconnect` via unix socket~~ ✅
- HIP report generation (`gp-hip`)
- Native route + DNS management (`gp-route` / `gp-dns`) — replace the
  bundled vpnc-script entirely with rtnetlink + systemd-resolved /
  resolvconf / direct backends, à la Tailscale
- Multi-portal profiles (`pgn portal add`, `pgn portal use`)
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- systemd unit
- Prometheus metrics endpoint

### Phase 3 — differentiation

- Okta headless auth (no browser, even for the IdP step)
- Client certificate auth (PEM / PKCS#12)
- FIDO2 / YubiKey
- macOS, Windows
- NetworkManager plugin
